# NLP-Project---Relief-Call-Classification-and-NER-Dataset-on-Twitter-Data
A Project for Natural Language Processing Course

This project aims to prepare labeled dataset for
identify tweets containing calls for help shared during the
KahramanmarasÂ¸ earthquake and then perform classification with
SVM and two different BERTurk model. In addition prepare
labeled Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset to extract
names and location information. Information shared on social
media platforms during earthquakes and other disasters can
be a crucial resource for disaster management and emergency
response. Messages containing help requests can assist emergency
response teams in addressing the needs and demands of people
in the affected areas.
